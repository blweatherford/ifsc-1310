  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  
  <p>If I were to describe progressive enhancement in my own words, I would say that progressive enhancement is a way of designing web pages that focuses on achieving essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.</p>

  <p>What makes this methodology so important in web development is that it allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, In addition to providing an enhanced version of the page to people with more advanced browsers. By doing this you are designing your website in a way that allows as many people as possible to see your content, which is the most important part of a website.</p>
  
  <p>In a nutshell by using progressive enhancement you are giving your consumers a basic user experience and cross compatibility across browsers to ensure stability.</p>
