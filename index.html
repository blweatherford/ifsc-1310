  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  
  <p>If I were to describe progressive enhancement in my own words, I would say that progressive enhancement is a way of designing web pages that focuses on achieving essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.</p>

  <p>What makes this methodology so important in web development is that it allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, In addition to providing an enhanced version of the page to people with more advanced browsers. By doing this you are designing your website in a way that allows as many people as possible to see your content, which is the most important part of a website.</p>
  
  <p>In a nutshell by using progressive enhancement you are giving your consumers a basic user experience and cross compatibility across browsers to ensure stability.</p>

<section class="Reflection">
  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  
  <p>For the final revision, I ended up getting my mom and a couple of my friends to provide feedback with the initial design on what improvements that they would find necessary for a better website. The initial design only used HTML and CSS with a tiny amount of JS used for the contact form. At the time I had not validated the HTML code and there were some things I had missed that pertained to outdated html that I used. On initial interaction I was told that everything was easy to read and was told the dark grey background in the first section about the centaur with the white text made it very easy to read and grabbed their attention. The three people I asked didnt give me many suggestions. I told them I planned to add a slideshow to the middle of the page and they agreed it would be nice to see more of the Centaur. The other main suggestion they gave me was adding a dark mode for the website, but seeing as I dont have much experience with JS currently I decided not to add the feature as I didnt want to add a broken feature.</p>
  
  <p>The modified version now incorporates the new slideshow in the middle of the page underneath the first information section on the homepage. This feature I feel adds more attention to the product and gives potential consumers more of an idea of what the centaur looks like. No changes were made to the layout overall besides the validation of the HTML used. I had trouble with the slideshow at first getting it to stay in the middle of the section but found a solution that I think made it look a little better on the page. </p>
  
  <p>Something that I wish i could have added to the website dealt with the use of JS to make the images in the Specs section zoom in when clicked on. I didnt know how to incoprate this feature into the website and if I could come back to it later with more knowledge in JS I would add this feature in a heartbeat.</p>
